Log Query Interface
Disha wants to create a Log Query Interface . While Disha is Working on list , she found that she is spending more time on searching for a word in that list. So, I avoid spending of more time on searching the entire list to get something , she decided to build a log and query interface , where she could find the desired word by finding all the words with that prefix.
But the task of Disha is not to just find the words , she wants to know what is the count of words in the list have a word as prefix.

Explanation
Initialize Trie:

Create an empty trie with a root node.

Insert Strings into Trie:

Insert "apple":
Trie: a -> ap -> app -> appl -> apple (count: 1)
Insert "app":
Trie: a -> ap -> app (count: 2) -> appl -> apple (count: 1)
Insert "apricot":
Trie: a -> ap -> app (count: 2) -> apr -> apric -> aprico -> apricot (count: 1)
Insert "apricots":
Trie: a -> ap -> app (count: 2) -> apr -> apric -> aprico -> apricot (count: 1), apricots (count: 1)
Insert "orange":
Trie: o -> or -> ora -> orang -> orange (count: 1)
Insert "orangutan":
Trie: o -> or -> ora -> orang -> orange (count: 1), orangutan (count: 1)
Insert "banana":
Trie: b -> ba -> ban -> bana -> banan -> banana (count: 1)
Insert "bananas":
Trie: b -> ba -> ban -> bana -> banan -> banana (count: 1), bananas (count: 1)
Insert "grape":
Trie: g -> gr -> gra -> grap -> grape (count: 1)
Insert "grapes":
Trie: g -> gr -> gra -> grap -> grape (count: 1), grapes (count: 1)
Insert "grapefruit":
Trie: g -> gr -> gra -> grap -> grape (count: 1), grapes (count: 1), grapefruit (count: 1)
Insert "dog":
Trie: d -> do -> dog (count: 1)
Insert "dogged":
Trie: d -> do -> dog (count: 1), dogged (count: 1)
Insert "dogs":
Trie: d -> do -> dog (count: 1), dogged (count: 1), dogs (count: 1)
Insert "dogg":
Trie: d -> do -> dog (count: 1), dogged (count: 1), dogs (count: 1), dogg (count: 1)
Insert "do":
Trie: d -> do (count: 2), dog (count: 1), dogged (count: 1), dogs (count: 1), dogg (count: 1)

Process Queries:

Query "apple" → Count: 4 (Trie: a -> ap -> app -> appl -> apple (count: 1))
Query "app" → Count: 4 (Trie: a -> ap -> app (count: 2) -> appl -> apple (count: 1))
Query "apricots" → Count: 2 (Trie: a -> ap -> app (count: 2) -> apr -> apric -> aprico -> apricot (count: 1), apricots (count: 1))
Query "orange" → Count: 3 (Trie: o -> or -> ora -> orang -> orange (count: 1), orangutan (count: 1))
Query "orangutan" → Count: 1 (Trie: o -> or -> ora -> orang -> orange (count: 1), orangutan (count: 1))
Query "banana" → Count: 0 (Not in the trie)
Query "do" → Count: 1 (Trie: d -> do (count: 2), dog (count: 1), dogged (count: 1), dogs (count: 1), dogg (count: 1))
Input Format:

The first line contains N, Q: the number words in list and number of queries.

N lines follow, with words (of list) consisting of lowercase letters. The sum of their lengths won't be greater than 10^6

Q lines follow, with words (queries) consisting of lowercase letters. The sum of their lengths won't be greater than 10^6
Output Format:

For each query print the number of words in list which have actual word as prefix.
Constraints

1 ≤ N,Q ≤ 10^5
The sum of the lengths of words in the list won't be greater than 10^6.
The sum of the lengths of words in the queries won't be greater than 10^6.
All words (both in the list and queries) consist of lowercase letters."""
