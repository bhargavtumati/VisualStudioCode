"""Palindromic binary representation
Given an integer A find the Ath number whose binary representation is a palindrome.

NOTE:

Consider the 1st number whose binary representation is palindrome as 1, instead of 0
Do not consider the leading zeros, while considering the binary representation.
Example 1
Input
A = 1
Output
1
Explanation
1st Number whose binary representation is palindrome is 1

Example 2:

Input:

9
Output:

27
Explanation
9th Number whose binary representation is palindrome is 27 (11011)

Constraints:
1 <= A <= 20000"""
