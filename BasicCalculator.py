Basic Calculator
Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note:
You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

Example 1:

Input: s = "1 + 1"

Output: 
2


Example 2:

Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output:
 3
Example 3:

Input:
s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"</br> 
Output:
  23
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '. s represents a valid expression.
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
