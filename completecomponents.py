"""
Count the Number of Complete Components
You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n vertices, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices ai and bi.

Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.

A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

Examples:

Input:

 n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]


Output:

3

Input:

n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
Output:

1
Constraints:

1<= n <= 50
0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
ai != bi
There are no repeated edges.
