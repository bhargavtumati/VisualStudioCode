739.Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have 
to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future 
day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

Example 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
