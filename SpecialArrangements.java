/*Special Arrangements
You're a daring jewel thief infiltrating the vault of the century, protected by a complex combination lock. Each dial holds a glittering gem, their values encoded in integers (represented by the nums array).
To crack the lock, you need to arrange the gems in a specific order: for each adjacent pair, either the first gem's value must divide evenly into the second's, or vice versa. But cracking such a combination requires more than just brute force!

You're given an array of nums containing the values of the vault's gems (n distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9).
Your mission is to find the total number of possible "special" arrangements of these gems, where every pair satisfies the divisibility requirement (i.e., forms a harmonious sequence). Since the number of special arrangements can be huge, you need to return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid numerical overflows.

Input/Output Format:
Input:
An array nums containing the gem values separated by spaces or commas.

Output:
Return a single integer representing the total number of special gem arrangements modulo 10^9 + 7.

Examples:
Input:
2 3 6 (Three gems in the vault)

Output:
2 (Only two arrangements work: [3 6 2] and [2 6 3])

Input:
1 4 3 (Another vault to plunder)

Output:
2 (Similar to the first example, only two special arrangements exist: [3 1 4] and [4 1 3])

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 14 (Number of gems in the vault)
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 (Individual gem value)*/
