"""
Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

Input:
head: The head of the linked list. (0 <= length of the list <= 500)
k: The number of places to rotate the list. (0 <= k <= 2 * 10^9)

Output:
Return the head of the rotated linked list.

Examples:

Input:

head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

Output:
[4,5,1,2,3]
Input:

head = [0,1,2], k = 4

Output:

[2,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
