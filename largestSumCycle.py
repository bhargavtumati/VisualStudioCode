"""
Converging maze: largest sum cycle
You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit.(i.e. entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves).
The cells are named with an integer value from zero to N-1.
You have to find :
The sum of the largest sum cycle in the maze. Return -1 if they are no cycles.
	1. Sum of a cycle is the sum of the node number of all nodes in that cycle.
 input format 
	1. the first line has the number of cells N 
	2. The second line as the list of N values of the edge[] array. edge[i] contains cell number that can be reached from the cell 'i' in one step. Edge[i] is -1 if the 'I'th cell doesn't have an exit.

Output format:
The first line denotes the sum of the largest sum cycle.
