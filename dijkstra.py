"""
Dijkstras Algorithm
Given a weighted directed graph with N nodes and E edges, you need to find the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. The nodes are indexed from 0 to N−1, and the graph's edges have non-negative weights.

Sample Input-1:
The number of nodes (N). : 5
The number of edges (E). : 7
E triples of integers representing edges and their weights.
Source node (S). : 0

(0 1 2)
(0 2 4)
(1 2 1)
(1 3 7)
(2 3 3)
(2 4 5)
(3 4 2)

`

Sample Output-1:
Shortest distance from the source node to all other nodes.
(0 0)

Sample Output-2
0 0

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4 (number of nodes)

0 <= E <= 10^5 (number of edges)

0 <= u, v < N (node indices)

-10^9 <= weight <= 10^9 (edge weights)

The graph is guaranteed to be connected."""
