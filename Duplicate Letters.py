Duplicate Letters
Dholu is very creative and wants to play with strings and he has a very good idea. You have given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order

Input Format:
first line consists of a string
Output Format:
print the output string
Sample Input:
cbacdcbc

Sample Output:
abcd

Explanation: Since if we only collect unique letters, they come out to be 'c', 'b', 'a' and 'd' and when they are arranged lexicographically the output is abcd.

Constraints:
1<= s.length<= 10000
Note: Input consists of only lower case letters.
